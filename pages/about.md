Jimmy and the Wolfpack existed (though I hate to speak of it in the past tense, because if you offered us either a hundred bucks or maybe just a twelve-pack we could and would immediately reform) from about 2001 to about 2009.

There were two line ups, the NOLA one and the NYC one. We had three different horn players.
